# Express.js Route Parameter Handling and Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to handling route parameters and missing error handling. The bug occurs when a route parameter is not properly parsed or when an error occurs during data retrieval. The solution shows how to fix the bug with proper error handling and input validation. 

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains code that uses the Express.js framework to handle a route with a parameter, `:id`, representing a user's ID. The code retrieves user data based on the provided ID. However, it lacks proper error handling. If the provided `:id` parameter is not a valid integer or no user matches the ID, the application will crash or return unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the fix for this bug. It includes checks to ensure that the `:id` parameter is a valid integer before attempting to parse it and includes detailed error handling for when a user is not found using appropriate HTTP status codes.
